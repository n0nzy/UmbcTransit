My android studio version 0.8.9 uses:
- Gradle Plugin: v0.12, which depends on Gradle 1.10

My android studio version 0.8.11:
- supports Gradle Plugin v0.12.0
- can support Gradle Plugin: v0.13, which requires Gradle 2.1 (this plugin not in use in any projects; i only have Gradle 2.0 installed) 

My android studio version 0.8.14 uses:
- Gradle Plugin: v0.12.0, which depends on Gradle 2.0

Not a good idea to open the 'Project: umbctransit' in a version of Android Studio later than 0.8.9, because the project is currently configured to use Studio's gradle-plugin v0.12, and manually set to local installation of Gradle 1.10

- Gradle Plugin: v0.13.0 (not installed), requires Gradle 2.1

- Gradle Plugin: v0.14.0 (not installed), requires Gradle 2.1, but requires Android Studio version 0.9.0

- Gradle Plugin: v0.14.4 (not installed), supports Gradle 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1
